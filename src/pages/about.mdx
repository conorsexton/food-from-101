# What’s all this then?

First, let’s get this out of the way: we never meant to start a food blog. (And that’s not what this is!)

It’s our anti-food-blog recipe repository, and answer to “Please send me that recipe!” You’ll find some of our favorite recipes re-written and adapted to reflect how we actually make them, plus a few original creations.

You _won’t_ find long-winded soliloquies or keyword-stuffed prep instructions — just the ingredients and steps you need.

So browse away, let us know what you think, and happy kitchening!

## Who’s the “we” here?

We’re Conor and Nolan, a couple living, cooking, and baking together in Minneapolis. (Okay realistically, Nolan does most of the baking.)

## Food From 101?

Moving to our first apartment together in St. Paul was what kickstarted our love for cooking and spending time in the kitchen together. We’d gone from a tiny no-counters kind of place to a dreamy kitchen with a big island, lots of windows, and all the space we needed.

Our street address (and the end of our zip code!) was 101, we liked the idea of commemorating that special place, and the domain was available ✌️
